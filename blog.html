                <p>As a University of Miami graduate with a major in public relations, and minors in marketing and psychology, I relate very well towards manipulating "data" or communication in words and images in a highly curated aspect for the intended audience. Whether it is a pitch for an article to a news publication, or a advertising piece to market a product, the data provided is somewhat altered to garner attention, engagement, or persuasion for the intended user. The fact that charts also tell parts of a story, and may or may not tell the entire story, is a rational realization from the chapters that begin to unfold the ways in "How Charts Lie." It is up to the designer of the piece to tell the story accurately, but to also remember that it is okay if they only tell a piece of the story while remaining truthful and allowing the users to fill in the gaps with questions or their own ideas. </p>
              
                <p>The idea that we have been misled since childhood in the idea that charts must be easy to read from a quick first glance has been my mental construct, and the same for a majority of my generation, if I may. It is not an aspect that I had realized until reading these chapters. If a chart seems a bit more complex than a first glance view, I perceive it is out of my league and move on. However learning that there are the proper indicators and structure for even the most complex of graphs, and learning the tools to make it discernable is empowering. It is outrageous in the examples of these chapters how the news can exaggerate graphs for quick glance views and lead us to the communicator's conclusion so wrongly. It is comforting that a data vizualization expert such as the author can reveal that charts do take significant attention and time in order to read through and see the story within their structure.</p>
