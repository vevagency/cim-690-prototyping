                <p>The staggering effect of the media democratized in today's social landscape has altogether changed the vehicle for "news". What once was fact-checked and worked thoroughly for high reliability using "The Elements of Journalism" is now overpowered by the fast-paced online media commerce of influencer opinion. These "verified" (blue checkmark) source accounts are in their position for a reason, they share relevant information, and that "reach" that they have determines what makes "headlines." Nowadays, headlines are actually just the captions under a photo on Instagram and determined as valid according to the number of "likes" on the post. This is what our current democratized news system looks like, which is a bit of an extreme statement, because our foundational news institutions still exist and continue, but nevertheless this situation of distorted news digestion remains true for milennials who don't engage with traditional news. The graph below is a result of this environment, where public relation tactics of likeability, visibility, and engagement are prioritized. </p>

                <img src="image/blog/journalists-vs-pr-chart-truthful-art.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Journalists Versus Public Relations Chart image" height="550" width="550">

                <p>As mentioned in the book, â€œNews is a report of what a news organization has recently learned about matters of some significance or interest to the specific community that news organization serves," Jack Fuller, ex-president and publisher of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. To a great extent, that definition is what most online influencers achieve very well. To garner such popularity, they provide value to their users, and success as a result of a unique selling point, or unique creative method on their account, i.e. imagery, tone of voice, consistency, message. These influencers are people that have the power to make it a trend to include more news-worthy information. Some do by only sharing the most notorious disasters online, which become "viral" and "meme-worthy". But if they were aware of the importance that visualized data can help the regular citizen make more informed decisions in the longterm, then maybe they may realize their role has put real reporters out of jobs, and it is their responsibility to share some real facts in return for their online clout; a "Golden Rule of Social Media" to complement "The Elements of Journalism". Potentially more awareness of this need to receive facts from influencers can lead their followers, and us as a collective, to see beyond the present of immediate gratification, and begin to digest more informative materials towards a more determined future. </p>

                <p>These influencers can also provide visually appealing demonstrations by using best color practices that compliment their brand, make it more accessible, and provide an online tribute to the natural world through color.  By informing influencers of accessiblity towards people with color blindness, they may consider how hues and brightness make an effect on these users. To consider this accessibility can make the current "data" they share more relevant to all types of people. The idea of using scenes of nature to create gradual color patterns is a skillful tool that many influencers would benefit from implementing in their practice. Applying these color practices to data in visual solutions can make it more diverse and engaging, while discerning for all users. Maybe if journalists and news organizations provided influencers with data such as this color palette information to better their online presence, then these online bloggers can be requested in return to share factual information. Potentially each news organization can partner with local influencers and make it part of the news room agenda to get their data visualizations and infographics on social media pages. Much important information gets lost on traditional media, and influencers can help make it more relevant, especially with the help of news reporters, and a rapport can begin to make the social media craze a bit more ethical.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-0">BLOG ENTRY #1 | JAN. 21, 2020 | "How Charts Lie" | Intro and Chapter 1</h5>
                <p>As a University of Miami graduate with a bachelors in public relations, marketing and psychology, and current pursuant of an interactive media masters degree, I relate very well towards manipulating "data" or communication in words and images in a highly curated aspect for the intended audience. Whether it is a pitch for an article to a news publication, or a advertising piece to market a product, or a website designed to make a sale, it is always a somewhat altered version of the overall encompassing data in order to garner attention, engagement, or persuasion of the target user. The fact that charts also tell parts of a story, and may or may not tell the entire story makes rational sense, yet is somehow brought upon as a realization to me, as the chapters begin to unfold the ways in "How Charts Lie." It is up to the designer of the piece to tell the story accurately, but to also remember that it is just as fine if they only tell a piece of the story, while remaining truthful and allowing the users to fill in the gaps with questions or their own ideas. As in marketing, curiosity is important, and giving the user space to look for more information on their own is a good strategy, as is providing clear supporting text in paragraph or emphasized text in a visually appealing manner to provide clarity and an overall sense of the message.</p>

                <p>The idea that we have been misled since childhood in the overgeneralized teaching point that charts must be easy to read from a quick first glance has been my mental construct, and the same for a majority of my generation, if I may. If a chart seems a bit more complex than a first glance view, I perceive it is out of my league and move on. This mental construct has not been to pay more attention to it, but rather to decide that it simply wasn't meant for me. It is outrageous how the news media has used this tactic to lead us to biased conclusions. However, it is empowering to learn that given the proper indicators, and if good design is applied, then most graphs can be accurately deciphered. Also, approaching these data visualizations almost as if engaging in a brain challenge game, or as if solving a critical thinking problem, may help us confront them as better armed for battle. For example, a new artillery trick is to mentally separate the quadrants of a chart and define what is going on in each section. It will be easier to beat these brain games by learning these types of tools, while also knowing that I am engaging in a critical thinking exercise will help it be more approachable in regards to time and effort required. By having a new point of view towards charts as brain games, and becoming prepared with tools to win, the brain will begin to get stronger by forging new connections and leaning towards newer mental constructs.</p>
