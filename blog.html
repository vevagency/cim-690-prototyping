                <p>As a University of Miami graduate with a bachelors in public relations, marketing and psychology, and current pursuant of an interactive media masters degree, I relate very well towards manipulating "data" or communication in words and images in a highly curated aspect for the intended audience. Whether it is a pitch for an article to a news publication, or a advertising piece to market a product, or a website designed to make a sale, it is always a somewhat altered version of the overall encompassing data in order to garner attention, engagement, or persuasion of the target user. The fact that charts also tell parts of a story, and may or may not tell the entire story makes rational sense, yet is somehow brought upon as a realization to me, as the chapters begin to unfold the ways in "How Charts Lie." It is up to the designer of the piece to tell the story accurately, but to also remember that it is just as fine if they only tell a piece of the story, while remaining truthful and allowing the users to fill in the gaps with questions or their own ideas. As in marketing, curiosity is important, and giving the user space to look for more information on their own is a good strategy, as is providing clear supporting text in paragraph or emphasized text in a visually appealing manner to provide clarity and an overall sense of the message.</p>

                <p>The idea that we have been misled since childhood in the overgeneralized teaching point that charts must be easy to read from a quick first glance has been my mental construct, and the same for a majority of my generation, if I may. If a chart seems a bit more complex than a first glance view, I perceive it is out of my league and move on. This mental construct has not been to pay more attention to it, but rather to decide that it simply wasn't meant for me. It is outrageous how the news media has used this tactic to lead us to biased conclusions. However, it is empowering to learn that given the proper indicators, and if good design is applied, then most graphs can be accurately deciphered. Also, approaching these data visualizations almost as if engaging in a brain challenge game, or as if solving a critical thinking problem, may help us confront them as better armed for battle. For example, a new artillery trick is to mentally separate the quadrants of a chart and define what is going on in each section. It will be easier to beat these brain games by learning these types of tools, while also knowing that I am engaging in a critical thinking exercise will help it be more approachable in regards to time and effort required. By having a new point of view towards charts as brain games, and becoming prepared with tools to win, the brain will begin to get stronger by forging new connections and leaning towards newer mental constructs.</p>
