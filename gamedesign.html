              <h4>Objective</h4>
              <p>Explain the goal of your game/experience in 2-3 sentences.</p>

              <h4>Gameplay Mechanics</h4>
              <p>This is where you explain your game's core loop(s), whether your game is real time or turn based, single player or multiplayer, social or not, and any key aspects of your gameplay - this could be anything from your power-up system to special enemy types to the ability to rewind time.</p>

              <h4>Level Design</h4>
              <p>Here you need to think about what principles you will follow when designing a level. Describe what a typical level will look like but also list any constraints your game's design will place on the levels. For example, you may decide that every level will have a section where the player cannot mess up, or you may want to note that levels in your game should designed so no backtracking is necessary.</p>

              <p>If you game is auto-generated, use this space to describe how difficulty will increase over time.</p>

              <h3>Technical</h3>
              <h4>Scenes</h4>
              <p>Describe each screen in your game, from the main menu to the gameplay screen to your high score screen and anything in between. Are there any screens you could remove from your MVP? For example, what if there was no main menu and players started immediately at the gameplay? Mark this nice to have screens with "(after MVP)".</p>

              <p>As you prototype your game and progress through iterations, be sure to add pictures and screenshots here!</p>
  
              <h4>Controls</h4>
              <p>How will the player interact with the game?</p>
  
              <h3>Minimum Viable Product Milestones</h3>
              <p>This is the section that should get updated the most often. You will be keeping track of what tasks you plan on completing each week. If you're new to projects this long, you will have to make best guesses as to how long things will take.</p>

              <p>Before ordering your tasks on a week by week basis, first list every task on your plate. This should include everything you've listed in your GDD that will be in your MVP and all the non-technical work your game requires.</p>
                
              <p>For every task, estimate how many days it will take. If you think it will take less than a day, round up to a day.</p>
                
              <p>Add all the days together. Multiply by 1.2 to give yourself buffer time for unexpected delays. If you end up with more than 25 days of estimated tasks, do not change your estimates. Unless you have significant experience with large projects you should almost never change your estimates to be more optimistic. It is a big red flag if your gut tells you a task will take N days but after thinking about it you decide it won't take as long. You're almost always wrong.</p>
                
              <p>If you have more than 25 days of work left, cut features. If it doesn't hurt, you aren't cutting enough features.</p>
                
              <p>Revise your design document if necessary if you end up making significant changes to your game's design.</p>
                
              <p>Only once you have a list of tasks that fit in 25 days should you start dividing them up week by week.</p>

              <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
              <p>Read your design document over to make sure everything makes sense. Check dependencies -- tasks should be in order of completion!</p>
